# WebSocket LED-Matrix ESP

It connects to [a WebSocket server](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/websocket-ledmatrix-remote/).

⚠️ Warning: Do not flash the ESP over USB while the matrix is connected even with a power source attached to the matrix!
Disconnect the matrix and flash the ESP on its own.
Otherwise, the matrix will light up bright and will damage the ESP power circuits.
Yes, I am sure.
I've killed multiple ESP.
